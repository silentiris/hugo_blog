Then why do you look sad?

Because you speak to me with words, and I look at you with feelings.

It’s impossible to have a conversation with you. You never have any ideas, just feelings.

That’s not true. Feelings contain ideas.

Let’s try to have a serious conversation. You’ll tell me what you like, what you want, and I’ll do the same. Go on, you start.

Flowers, animals... Blue skies, the sound of music... I don’t know. Everything. And you?

Ambition. Hope... Movement, accidents. What else? I don’t know. Everything.

You see? I was right five years ago. We don’t understand each other. What can I do? I don’t know what to do.

How’s the old man?

Not bad. I’v found an idea for a novel. I won’t describe people’s lives, but life itself, just life. Everything that takes place between people: space, sounds and colours. It should be possible. Joyce tried to do it, but I should be able to improve on him.
