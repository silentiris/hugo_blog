{{< quote poetry en >}}

There’s a point at 7,000 RPM  
where everything fades.  
The machine becomes weightless.  
Just disappears.  
And all that’s left is a body  
moving through space and time.

7,000 RPM.  
That’s where you meet it.  
You feel it coming.  
It creeps up on you, close in your ear.  
Asks you a question.  
The only question that matters.  
“Who are you?”

{{< /quote >}}

在 7,000 RPM 有一点，  
一个其它一切都消逝的点。  
车变轻了，  
消逝了，  
只剩身体移动在时空中。

7,000 RPM，  
这就是你遇到它的那点。  
你感觉到它来了，  
它慢慢地来到，你慢慢地听到。  
一个问题，  
一个仅有的问题，  
「我是谁？」[^1]
