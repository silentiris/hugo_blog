影片中大量「无意义」的「空镜头」以及同步的单色调、自然简单的纯声成就了其艺术价值，从俗世琐事和五光十色和尘世喧嚣中脱离，升华为艺术和哲学。一个疑问慢慢浮上了我的心头：寻问内心的沉思，寻问人生的沉思，才是艺术和哲学的真谛？本原、本质，应为自然科学？

Oh God, for me it’s prison

*Stalker*

Let everything that’s been planned  
come true.  
Let them believe.  
And let them have a laugh  
at their passions.

Because what they call passion  
actually is not some emotional energy,  
but just the friction between  
their souls and the outside world.

And most important,  
let them believe in themselves  
Let them be helpless like children,  
because weakness is a great thing,  
and strength is nothing.

*Tao Te Ching 76*

When a man is just born,  
he is weak and flexible,  
when he dies,  
he is hard and insensitive.

When a tree is growing,  
it’s tender and pliant,  
but when it’s dry and hard,  
it dies.

Hardness and strength  
are death’s companions.  
Pliancy and weakness are  
expressions of the freshness of being.

Because what has hardened  
will never win.

*Writer*

A man writes because he’s tormented, because he doubts. He needs to constantly prove to himself and the others that he’s worth something. And if I know for sure that I’m a genius? Why write then? What the hell for? Well, I must say that we exist for...

In any case, all this technology of yours... all those blast furnaces, wheels... and other bullshit are only designed in order to work less and eat more. They are all just crutches, artificial limbs. And mankind exists in order to create... works of art. Unlike all other human activities, this one is unselfish. Great illusions! Images of the absolute truth!

*Revelation 6*

And there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair. And the moon became like blood... And the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind. And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich and the chiliarchs and the strong and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains; and they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”

*Arseny Tarkovsky*

So summer is gone,  
Leaving no epitaph.  
It’s still warm in the sun,  
Only that’s not enough.

All that true could have come,  
Like a five-fingered fluff,  
Folded into my palm,  
Only that’s not enough.

No evil was slighted  
in the good aftermath,  
World was festively lighted,  
Only that’s not enough.

Life forever was tucking,  
Caring, making me laugh.  
I was really lucky,  
Only that’s not enough.

No leaves ever seared,  
No limbs broken rough.  
Day, like glass, washed all clear,  
Only that’s not enough.

*Fyodor Tyutchev*

I love your eyes, my darling friend,  
Their play, so passionate and brightening,  
When a sudden stare up you send,  
And like a heaven-blown lightning,  
It’d take in all from end to end.  
But there’s more that I admire:  
Your eyes when they’re downcast  
In bursts of love-inspired fire,  
And through the eyelash goes fast  
A somber, dull call of desire.
